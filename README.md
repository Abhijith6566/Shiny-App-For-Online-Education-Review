Original purpose of the dataset was to explore the impact of online education based on the impact COVID-19 had on education. Since, having to move from traditional classroom environments, that has provided vital roles in nurturing and molding the life of individuals, to virtual education. After analyzing the data we discovered that it can be used to review the satisfactory level of the learners.It can also be used to investigate the demographics of the students, which gives us an inside viewpoint of the learners.For example, to view their gender, level of education, age, their economic class, or to determine if they are from an urban or rural home location.\n
We can also determine the extracurricular activities, their interests, and performance in online classes. One of the limitations of this dataset is the inablility to for it to be used for is to view their specific grades and the number of classes they're enrolled in.
